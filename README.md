# SUBSTREAM

Have you ever screamed out in frustration when you cannot find the movie or tv-show you want to watch? You already subscribe to 5 services and it seems like none of them have it available. Rather than waste time scrolling through Google or apps, use Substream. It allows you to search for any movie or tv show and find what streaming service its on. It filters out anything that requires add-ons, on-demand or anything that truly wouldn't be on that platform for their base monthly price. Substream also searches for any movies on a free streaming service. Use it, abuse it, let me know the bugs. Stream on!
